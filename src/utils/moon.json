The full moon was the third in a series of “supermoons,” when the Moon is closer to Earth in its orbit -- known as perigee -- and about 14 percent brighter than usual. It was also the second full moon of the month, commonly known as a “blue moon.” As the super blue moon passed through Earth’s shadow, viewers in some locations experienced a total lunar eclipse. While in Earth’s shadow, the moon also took on a reddish tint – which is sometimes referred to as a “blood moon.”"

                        "description": "January 31 brings a lunar trifecta: the Super Blue Blood Moon! NASA TV will offer a livestream starting at 5:30 a.m. This full moon is the third in a series of “supermoons,” when the Moon is closer to Earth in its orbit -- known as perigee -- and about 14 percent brighter than usual. It’s the second full moon of the month, commonly known as a “blue moon.” The super blue moon will pass through Earth’s shadow to give viewers in the right location a total lunar eclipse. While the Moon is in the Earth’s shadow it will take on a reddish tint, known as a “blood moon.”  More: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/super-blue-blood-moon-coming-jan-31  Credit: NASA 360"

                        "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. This is Episode 114: “The Value of the Moon”. I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts and other folks about their part in America's space exploration program. And today we're going to talk about the target of a lot of our current efforts: the Moon. NASA's Artemis program is focused on returning American astronauts to the Moon by 2024 through the use of the Space Launch System rocket, the Orion Spacecraft, the Gateway Lunar Outpost and a new lunar lander. And to do so in a sustainable way, that is to go to the Moon to stay, to learn how to support astronauts in that environment and in the process get ourselves ready to go on from there to Mars. As a part of that mission, we mean to make the best use of the natural resources on the Moon, and that's very different than what the Apollo program set out to do 50 years ago. It also prompts an echo of President Kennedy's question: why the Moon? Well today we're going to start scratching the surface of answering that question by talking to the self-described cheerleader-in-chief for the Moon. Dr. Samuel Lawrence is a planetary scientist in the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Division here at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. And he is the lead lunar exploration scientist at JSC. His research is focused on using petrology which is the study of rocks and the conditions under which they form. I know because I looked it up. His research is focused on using petrology and remote sensing to investigate the composition, origin and evolution of planetary surfaces. He's been heavily involved in the development and testing and the science operations of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter which is now ten years into studying the Moon up close. He is also busy in Project Artemis in the formulation of science objectives and operations for the next generation of exploration on the Moon. As they say, “we are going.” And today we talk about what we hope to do and to learn when we get there. Okay then. Here we go.  [ Music ]  Host: Let me start by helping to introduce the audience to who you are. Where does your interest in the Moon come from? Does it come out of the Apollo missions from 50 years ago or some other aspect of astronomy or geology?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, that's a very good question. Back when I started into graduate school in the 2000's, discovery of the potential microfossils in Meteorite ALH84001 was in the news and so like many people I actually went to graduate school to do Mars work.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: Mars. But I've always been interested in lunar exploration. Starting when I was a kid growing up, we had the space shuttle, had just started to fly. That's the reason why I'm here, and one of my earliest memories is watching Columbia launch on her first flight as STS-1. And so that's very inspirational. It has an effect on people. And keep in mind the space shuttle wasn't just -- at the time it was first launching, it was the tool that was going to open up the space frontier to the human species and we were all going to get a chance to ride in the space shuttle.  Host: You were going to go there, back and forth all the time.  Samuel Lawrence: We were going to go, yeah. I had a pamphlet that was put into a lot of Cheerios boxes when Columbia's first flights were going on. It was like, \"You will ride to work one day on a space shuttle.\" And you read that stuff and it does have an impact on you. And I think that actually did pull in a lot of young people in the early 1980's into the science, technology, engineering and math fields. So it does have, you know -- the space program does have a demonstrable impact on what young people choose to do with their careers. But again, during the 80's it was sort of assumed that we would all be -- you know, the 21st century was right around the corner. We would have moon bases and people on Mars. And the first President Bush hopped up there in 1988 and says, \"We're going to back to the Moon to stay and then on to Mars.\"  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: And so like most people, like most fourth-graders, when the president hops up there and says that, you might reasonably expect it's going to happen. And it's really kind of a shame it really didn't turn out the way we had been told. That is truly unfortunate because it does indicate something about our ability to make and follow long-term plans as a culture and as a society. But anyway, to answer your actual question, I'd always figured I would go to college to be an aerospace engineer. But I read -- you know, growing up in the 90's, you know, there was a lot of backing and forthing. And I read some op-eds by a guy named Paul Spudis and I was like, \"Wow, this makes really good sense.\" And so I was very excited about aerospace. I was going to go to college to be aerospace. And then I read a book by the legendary lunar geologist Don Wilhelms who did a lot of work during Apollo. And it was very interesting and I had this very epiphany that if you're really going to do space in the 21st century, then understanding where the resources are to enable human exploration is going to be a really important question.  Host: And you're talking about the resources that are out there in space.  Samuel Lawrence: Out there in space, that's right. Yes.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: And so I changed course slightly and became a geologist. And you know, geology's a very interesting field. It's very integrated. Any given day you might have to understand biology and physics and thermodynamics and chemistry in order to understand the history of rocks and how it worked on this planet. And in the book that Don Wilhelms wrote, “To a Rocky Moon,” he made the really cogent point that up until the space age, the Moon had been an object of fascination for astronomers. But the space program and the space race converted it into an object we could explore and understand using principles of terrestrial geology to understand how the Moon worked. And the great gift of Apollo was that it essentially opened up our understanding of the entire solar system and the universe around us in a way we could understand. And so when I went to college, I went -- or when I went to graduate school rather to get my doctorate in planetary science, I originally did it to do Mars work. And then I met -- and then I just sort of realized there was a lot of interesting stuff to be done on the Moon. And everyone else was doing Mars work, so I figured, I might as well just switch over to moon work and then I'll have less competition.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: Which proved to be an interesting choice.  Host: Have you been at NASA for your whole career?  Samuel Lawrence: No. No. I was hired three -- I was on the research faculty at Arizona State University and I was hired at Johnson Space Center three years ago specifically to shore up their lunar expertise in anticipation of a new program of lunar exploration.  Host: I read an article in getting ready for today that quoted you as saying the “Moon is the Rosetta Stone for the whole solar system.’’  Samuel Lawrence: That's actually true.  Host: That's pretty high praise.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah.  Host: Tell me why you think that? What is it that we can learn studying the Moon that teaches us about the rest of the solar system?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, that is a very good question. So in general, when we went to the Moon the first time, we didn't really understand -- there were still major questions in the 60's about where did the Moon come from? There are these features on the lunar surface that look very much like rivers. And so there were people, serious scientists making serious suggestions there might have been liquid water on the Moon at one point. They look just like rivers. So they must be.  Host: Well if it's the evidence of your eyes and it's the only evidence you have.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. That's right. So then we went to the Moon and we discovered, as I sort of alluded to previously, that the Moon gave us this insight into planetary processes, the way geology works in other planets. And one of the reasons -- so we actually landed on one of things that looks like a river.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: And discovered it was actually a lava channel and the Moon had never had liquid water on its surface and that the Moon was not just an asteroid that had been captured in lunar orbit. But we discovered that it was very similar to a rocky planet. It had a crust, a mantel and a core and it had very likely been created by a Mars-size impactor hitting the primordial earth and then the materials thrown off by that impact aggregated in low Earth orbit and differentiated into the Moon.  Host: It's formerly a piece of this planet.  Samuel Lawrence: Right. Which explains why the chemistries of the two bodies are so similar in some respects. They're very different in others. But in some respects they are actually pretty similar. And so but the biggest reason why I say that Moon is the Rosetta Stone of the solar system is we landed with astronauts who did field work in key locations on the lunar surface. From that field work -- they picked up samples, they did geology in the field, they selected -- they carefully selected samples, well more carefully in some cases than others. But they selected samples that were tied back to specific locations on the lunar surface. And from that we brought it back here to Houston and then distributed those samples all over the world and did radiometric age dating, figured out how old the samples were. And very similarly to -- you know when you cut down a tree you count the number of rings?  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: And that tells you how old the tree is. Well, on another planet, especially ones that don't have atmospheres, it's the number of craters that tells you -- they can be used to infer how old the surface is. The more craters there are, the older the surface is.  Host: The longer it's been there exposed to passing asteroids.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. That's right. And so there are always exceptions to every rule and that's sort of a gross oversimplification of it. But in general that rule holds. The older the surface, the more craters there are. So what you could do is you could count the areas near the Apollo landing sites, see how many craters are on those areas and then figure out because we have samples, the radiometric age dates, you know, see how old they were. And then that time scale has actually been extended to every single one of the inner terrestrial planets. Mercury, Mars, Vesta. And it really is this gift that has kept on giving. You can make a pretty good case in a sense it is actually what happened that most of the discoveries we've made in planetary science for the past five decades are directly or indirectly related to the discoveries made by the Apollo astronauts on the surface of the Moon. That was landing in six locations for only a few days at a time.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: For over a two-year period. So imagine what's going to happen when we go back to stay. I cannot predict it. That's why you explore, right? But in general we do really need to go back to the Moon and get more samples and understand the radiometric age dates of other locations on the Moon. Because it sort of turned out that the Apollo -- the six Apollo landing sites and the Soviet landing sites were all actually in a very narrow band along the equator of the Moon and they're not actually truly representative of the Moon as a whole.  Host: Not distributed across, around the whole body.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. Yeah. So we do actually need to go back and get more samples and understand when things happened on the Moon. And that will actually help us to understand when things happened in all the other terrestrial planets too. So that's one of the key objectives for what we're going to do for future lunar missions as well.  Host: I must ask for everyone like me that doesn't know precisely what radiometric dating is.  Samuel Lawrence: Well, there are certain isotopes that decay over time. If you've -- I guess it's -- for those of us who grew up during the Cold War, it's probably an easier story to tell than others. But basically when a rock is erupted and forms onto a planetary body, it has certain elements that degrade naturally over time, radioactive decay. You can measure the abundances. And the way the decay rates are known. They've been measured in laboratories. You can measure the amount of these radionuclides in a rock and figure out based on what the abundances are how old the rock is.  Host: How long it's been deteriorating.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah, that's right. How long the radioelements have been decaying over time. And then do math and figure it out.  Host: See, the math part is the hard part that keeps --  Samuel Lawrence: That's actually the easy part. It's the measurement that's the hard part, but sure.  Host: You've started to touch on some of the importance of the science of what we can learn at the Moon. We learned about the age of the planets from the Moon. How do you characterize generally -- and then we'll get more specific -- about the value of the science that we can get from going to the Moon?  Samuel Lawrence: Oh, it's immense. And the value you get from sending human explorers is going to be even larger. I think one of the key points I like to make which I sort of already have made is that we only landed on the Moon with human beings six times. And they only explored a very small, vanishingly small area of the lunar surface. And they had intense schedule pressure, intense time pressure. And you'll always have that in spaceflight. But if you're going back and our paradigm this time around is different. We're not going on camping trips. We're going to stay. And that means we're going to -- if you've listened -- so right now at NASA our focus right now is the 2024 landing, the Artemis III mission. But beyond, yeah, what comes after that, we're still working on it. It's still in development.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: But the Space Council and the Vice President and the administrator have all been very clear we're going this time to stay and that requires a paradigm shift. It's not a camping expedition. We're going to go back and establish some sort of permanent presence on the lunar surface. And hopefully enable sustainable exploration in a way that doesn't -- you know, Apollo was fantastic but Apollo got cancelled and we don't want to have that happen again.  Host: And Apollo wasn't meant to go there to stay. Those missions were meant to go there for those short periods of time and come home.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: It's not like it was their fault. But now we're doing something different.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: We're going there to stay there to learn more about the place and to learn how we can stay there for a long time.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: Long periods of time.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: Are there certain aspects that you think of lunar science, if that's the right phrase to use, that are more valuable? What are the more valuable areas of science that we can learn about?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, I think there's a lot. Obviously there's -- in terms of understanding fundamental processes in the solar system, you know, the impact process. It affects every single planet in the solar system, not just the Moon. It affects Earth. That's why we're having this conversation, not, you know, some dinosaur radio show or something, right? I mean, that's why we're here.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: So the impact process is fundamental. Understanding what exposure to the space environment does to a surface. Understanding the physics of how light interacts with the surface to understand how do you use remote sensing techniques to interpret mineralogy and composition. All of these are fundamental processes across the solar system, and the Moon is a natural laboratory for them. The Moon also records the first billion years of the history of the Earth/Moon system. So on earth we have plate tectonics and that tends to recycle, you know, the continents. You know, materials from the earliest part of earth when one-celled organisms were starting to crawl out from under the ground and get onto the surface and start the long evolutionary path that resulted in us -- that's all gone. We don't have that record on this planet anymore.  Host: Because it shuffled up the evidence.  Samuel Lawrence: Yes. Well, evidence was destroyed by plate tectonics.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: But that evidence is there on the Moon. The Moon actually does record because it's the Earth/Moon system. It does -- the first billion years is available and can be found on the Moon. It's not saying you can say, \"Well, we're going to go to this spot and find it.\" But with a long-term presence on the lunar surface and lots of astronaut field work, you will find it eventually.  Host: Because there aren't plates and tectonics on the Moon.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. There's no plates. There's no tectonics. There's no recycling. You know, you will find it on the Moon and that's very interesting. That will tell us a lot about the rise -- you know, we're always talking about how to find life in the solar system, but how life evolved on Earth is a very, very important question for us. And a key part of that story is told on the Moon and only accessible there.  Host: It's not just the lack of plate tectonics. The Moon doesn't have weather or other things.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: Or other things that would disturb the evidence of these ancient events.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right, yeah.  Host: Does the Moon have natural resources?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, that's one of the great discoveries we made during Apollo. So even before -- even before we started to understand the nature of the polar volatile deposits that everyone is talking about today, even during the Apollo missions we began to have an understanding that the Moon actually did have a lot of resources that could enable future human exploration. Jack Schmidt, the only geologist who ever flew to the Moon, sampled a thing called a pyroclastic deposit at the Apollo 17 site. And it turns out those are spread across the near side of the Moon. They have a uniform chemical composition. We can use simple chemistry to extract water and oxygen from these materials. They're large. And so this field -- we had, you know, lunar base concepts in the 80's that would have worked that used these deposits as the feedstock to sustain astronauts on the lunar surface. So you know, we've been thinking about this problem for a long time. And then in 1994, the Clementine mission was flown and that discovered the first tantalizing hints of potential water deposits or potential volatile deposits I should say at the lunar poles.  Host: You want to make the distinction between water deposits and volatile deposits?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, there's a perception out there that there are these skating rinks hidden in the lunar poles. And unfortunately or that is not in fact the case. Our lunar reconnaissance orbiter mission has shown that there is no observable skating rinks at the lunar poles.  Host: No big slabs of ice.  Samuel Lawrence: No big slabs of ice. But it has detected pretty conclusively -- and there was a mission called LCROSS, the Lunar Crater Remote Observation Sensing Satellite.  Host: Good for you.  Samuel Lawrence: It was co-manifested on the LRO launch in 2009 that impacted into Cabeus Crater on the Moon and discovered the unambiguous presence of water, H2O. And a lot of other possibly economically useful materials as well like methane. And the reason this works -- we sort of skipped a step there -- is that the Moon has a slightly tilted orbit. And so there are areas at the lunar poles where the sun both never stops shining or effectively, you know, where you have a lot of illumination, and where the sun never shines.  Host: And when you say tilted, you're saying -- is that in reference to --  Samuel Lawrence: To the sun.  Host: To the sun.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: And the side of the Moon that we see is the same side all the time.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. Because the Moon is tidally locked. And there is no dark side of the Moon. This isn't an Isaac Asimov novel. There's a far side of the Moon which we never get to see, but it does get the same day/night cycle that the rest of the Moon does. But at the lunar poles, and this is why this is the target for the Artemis program, there are these areas of near-permanent illumination. And that has a couple of very positive effects. It means that the lunar night only lasts for something like 6-7 days at a stretch as opposed to 14 days. And you get 200-day periods each year where the sun never stops shining. And so it's a great spot to put down a stake hold and try to figure out how to live and work on other planets.  Host: Because you would have 200 days of sunlight to provide power?  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. And it's also a benign thermal environment. So on the moon there's this diurnal day/night cycle with an extreme of temperatures. And at the poles the swing is much less. It makes it easier to design habitats. It makes it easier to design systems to enable astronaut habitation on the surface.  Host: The change is less but still what's the temperature we're talking about? It's not an Earth kind of temperature.  Samuel Lawrence: It's equivalent to what you'd see on the International Space Station. So you're looking at around 200 degrees Fahrenheit in the daytime.  Host: Okay. So it's an environment that we already kind of know how to live in?  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: We're talking about natural resources. Are these natural resources -- it sounds like they would be useful to us in order to be able to go there and stay, as opposed to resources that are valuable that people would want to go and take away and sell somewhere.  Samuel Lawrence: It's very difficult to make the case that anything you mine in space is ever going to come back to Earth, for now. That could change in the future, but for right now the most near-term utility for lunar resources or any space resources -- and asteroids are chock full of useful things too, useful for people in space. So the things we're interested in are oxygen. Oxygen is rocket propellant, the stuff you breathe. We're interested in the possible, you know, volatiles which is hydroxyl, because that can be easily split off into oxygen and hydrogen which is rocket fuel. So there are -- you know, the near-term things --  Host: And the oxygen is water? Or the other way around?  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: Yes.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: The water can easily be converted into oxygen and hydrogen.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: So you know, we care about these things because oxygen is not only the stuff you breathe but it's oxidizer for rocket fuel. The hydrogen could also be rocket fuel. And so, like I said, the near-term thing is going to be focusing on enabling and making human exploration more sustainable. And the reason why is that it takes roughly six times -- there's a six-to-one gear ratio for getting stuff to the Moon, is sort of the lingo. And that's because for every pound you have to take to the lunar surface it takes roughly six pounds of fuel to get it there.  Host: Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: So give or take. So anything you can make on the lunar surface will eventually pay for itself, no matter how -- you know, and you always hear people talk about, \"Oh, you know, launch prices will go down eventually.\" Sure. Maybe. But it still doesn't change the fact you're still going to take six times as much fuel to get something to the lunar surface. So the more you can make on the Moon, the easier it will be to sustain a human presence there.  Host: The less you have to take.  Samuel Lawrence: The less you have to take.  Host: And the less of your resources here on Earth you have to expend for that portion of it.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. And also you have to learn how to live off the land if you're ever going to do Mars sustainably too. Because you're much, much farther away than, you know -- going to Mars is a much bigger technological leap and to really do it right, again, if you're going to do it in a way that doesn't eventually get cancelled, you want to have a sustainable presence on the Martian surface. You have to learn how to live off the land and use local resources. So it's an important paradigm shift and we can get started doing it on the Moon.  Host: You made reference to the lunar South Pole as a place where water, ice, has been found. Are there other of these valuable materials also in that same general region, making it a nice target for us to want to go to first?  Samuel Lawrence: I mean, what do you mean valuable materials?  Host: Well, the other natural resources.  Samuel Lawrence: Oh, other natural resources. Well, you can take lunar regolith and craft oxygen out of it pretty much anywhere on the Moon.  Host: And regolith is?  Samuel Lawrence: Lunar soil.  Host: Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah.  Host: And you can get oxygen out of the dirt?  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah. It's chemistry. You can do it. So you can -- some of the higher-grade resources are only found in equatorial regions of the Moon. So we'll have to -- like I said, this is a marathon, not a sprint. So we want to try to establish a beach head at the lunar South Pole and then eventually branch out to doing other missions to other places with gradually increasing capability. And that is why the Moon is very interesting, because it's not just an interesting scientific target. It's an interesting aspiration target. And we are not -- we don't just want to go to Moon and stay there. Going to the Moon actually gives you the capabilities you need to go anywhere you want in the solar system with any capability you might actually have.  Host: The things we can learn by going to the Moon and staying teach us.  Samuel Lawrence: And the workforce and technologies required to go back to the Moon will reenergize the aerospace industrial base and give us a body of knowledge which you know, I mean, has been lost or is on the verge of being lost. The Apollo generation is leaving us. No one alive, or very few people present at the agency today have designed a vehicle that's landed human beings on another world.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: And so we actually need to relearn how to do stuff we once learned how to do.  Host: We've been talking for a few minutes about what there is on the Moon and it occurs to me to make sure I understand how we know that. I mean, we didn't -- it's been 50 -- almost 50 years since the last human beings went there and gathered up samples for us to bring back. But is that the primary way that we know about what's on the Moon? Or have we learned it from other things? And I'm thinking particularly of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter that you also worked on.  Samuel Lawrence: Right. Well, over the past two decades we've had a nice renaissance in lunar exploration. Because it's not -- yeah, like I said, the Moon is a very accessible target and so it's something we can actually get to relatively straightforwardly. And so we've had certain -- the Clementine mission which gave us our first global mineralogical maps of the Moon and the first tantalizing hints of polar volatile deposits. We've also had a series of international missions. So we've had our colleagues in India launch the Chandrayaan mission, Chandrayaan I. And you have Chandrayaan II on its way to the Moon right now. We have had the European Space Agency launch SMART I. Our colleagues in Japan launched the KAGUYA mission. And KAGUYA was a fantastic mission. It produced a tremendously valuable global dataset for mineralogy and composition and topography. Then we also finally had the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter which was launched in 2009 as the first step of the -- first actual mission launched as part of the vision for space exploration, President Bush's former program to return to the Moon and stay and go on to Mars. And so LRO really I think is an example of how you know -- how science can enable human exploration. The mission was an exploration mission, an ESMD, Exploration Systems Mission Directorate mission, but it was staffed by Science Mission Directorate scientists and it was expressly designed to collect the data needed to enable a program of lunar exploration. But along the way, it also produced fantastic paradigm-shifting science and reinforced the Moon's status as the cornerstone of planetary science. So it made a series of very important discoveries. Among them abundance of volatile deposits at the lunar polar regions, but also new details of lunar mineralogy, lunar chemistry, the lunar landforms we can see with LRO's camera system, land forms as small as a meter in diameter.  Host: Wow.  Samuel Lawrence: So we've discovered all kinds of interesting things about lunar geology and the physics of the impact process, and created a whole new set of places we really want to send astronauts and their robotic precursors. So ten years into the mission, we have fuel for six or seven more years of operations. It's my finest hope that we can actually have LRO still in orbit and taking images when the next American steps onto the surface are taken. That would be a nice shot.  Host: Overhead shot.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah, that would be a nice symbolic closure of the mission.  Host: It would. I've wanted to set the stage for what there is there on the Moon to talk about what we would find when we go back. And part of your current portfolio is that you're working on developing the scientific objectives and the ways to do research during the Artemis missions that are coming up. It's still early in Artemis.  Samuel Lawrence: Still early.  Host: To the extent that you can, what's the outline of flights as we understand it so far?  Samuel Lawrence: Sure.  Host: What's the early plan?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, we had an exciting conference in January of 2018 called the Lunar Science for Landed Missions Workshop that went through and it was a great meeting and it went through -- it was sponsored by our friends at the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute. And it was at the Ames Research Center. And that was a great meeting. It was the science community coming together and going, \"These are our high-priority targets for where we'd like to send precursor missions and also\" -- it was mainly focused on precursor missions, but all the stuff from that workshop is equally applicable to the human missions. So an inherent part of the Artemis concept is that we have this thing called the Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program. So part of that is going to be -- it's an exciting program. It's leveraging the power of American enterprise and American industry to create a whole new set of lunar landing vehicles and designs to carry payloads to the lunar surface. And as part of that program, or actually as part of LDEP we're going to be landing exciting new missions for science at various spots around the lunar surface. I don't know where they're going to be landing, but they've selected instruments and they've selected payloads and there's several contractors working right now to create new American lunar landing systems that will take US payloads to the lunar surface. So that's really exciting, and that's a key capability. Because as I mentioned previously it's been five decades since the United States landed a spacecraft on the lunar surface. So I view LDEP as a really important part of our lunar portfolio and I'm really looking forward to the discoveries those missions are going to make.  Host: And if I can, to be clear, the LDEP payloads are not humans down to the Moon.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: These are research missions.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. But for this to work and work sustainably, we're going to have to have robots and humans working together. And I think that really does act as a force multiplier and it's going to make our exploration more effective and efficient and affordable when we can have regular cadence of missions going to the lunar surface. Because I could see scenarios where you are flying payloads designed to understand how to produce resources on the lunar surface to the moon on these LDEP payloads.  Host: If we're going to make use of those resources, we've got to have the tools to do it.  Samuel Lawrence: You've got to have the tools to do it. So I think it's a very good synergy between the mission directorates. It's a very exciting program. It's very innovative. It's going to be I think really exciting to see what American commerce can bring to the game in a way that is designed to enable innovation. And then moving on beyond LDEP which is our first missions as part of so-called Artemis umbrella are going to be LDEP missions.  Host: Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: In the early 2020's. And then we have the Artemis III and that's the first human mission as part of the Artemis program, presumably the seventh human lunar landing. And we have clear direction from above to land at the lunar South Pole which is a very interesting location. Like I said, there are -- it's an interesting environment that is enabling for future human exploration for long durations on the lunar surface. There's potential access to these volatile deposits which are not only interesting as a potential resource but are also interesting scientifically because it's that -- like I said, the first billion years of history. So we can go to these volatile deposits and presumably understand how organics and other cometary materials evolved over time in the solar system. That's an interesting thing scientifically. And there's also rocks we can pick up, and potential multiple -- potentially sampling multiple lunar terrains with access to the -- or excuse me, which could be accessed by landing at the South Pole. And by astronauts doing field work. So it's an interesting location. We're still working on some of the details here, but in general the idea is astronauts will land there and get out of the spacecraft, do space walks and make some very interesting new discoveries as they start to figure out what it's going to take to learn how to live and work on other planets.  Host: So if that's Artemis III, Artemis I and II and LDEP missions?  Samuel Lawrence: No, no.  Host: No? Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: Those are the missions formerly referred to as Exploration Mission I and Exploration Mission II on the space launch system.  Host: I see.  Samuel Lawrence: So those are Orion test flights in lunar space.  Host: Okay. And Artemis III gets the first humans back to the Moon?  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: And you made reference there, if I can -- there's a little exit ramp there. You were talking about doing exploration and finding evidence of the evolution of comets?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, sort of.  Host: Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: That was perhaps inelegantly phrased by me. What I'm alluding to here is again the Moon preserves its first billion years of history of the Earth/Moon system. And the reason why you have these polar volatile deposits is that again the Moon has these areas where the sun never shines. And when comets which are sort of wet, muddy ice balls hit the Moon, those volatiles during the lunar day/night cycle literally hop from one spot to another on the lunar surface. And eventually they get trapped in these cold traps at the poles. That process has presumably been going on for most of the history of the solar system. So by going to these volatile deposits in the lunar Polar Regions and studying them -- and we will get some of this data as we use these resource deposits for resources as we do resource extraction. As you start to really dig down into these deposits, you will get interesting information about how these volatile rich compounds, you know, water, methane, have involved over the complete four-billion-year history of the solar system.  Host: Because you will have had evidence of them from throughout that timeline.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. That's right. And we just went to the Moon and found it. And so it's going to be very interesting to see what develops out of this.  Host: How do they hop from one place to another on the Moon?  Samuel Lawrence: Boiling. So the water boils and then it gets so far -- some of it gets lost to the space environment, obviously.  Host: Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: Some of it lands when the sun goes down, and then the sun rises and the process repeats. And then eventually, so you know, from the giant ice ball that hit the Moon at the equator, a few molecules wind up in the lunar poles.  Host: It's dispersed.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah. But they get trapped in the polar environment. That's a gross oversimplification. I'm sure some of my colleagues are cringing at the thought of it.  Host: Well, but you can imagine why when I heard it hops from one place to another that you had more clarification than that.  Samuel Lawrence: Indeed.  Host: So you talked about up to Artemis III and the first humans that would land by 2024. Are there plans for further human missions in that timeline beyond that?  Samuel Lawrence: Sure. I mean, the idea is --  Host: Do we know much yet?  Samuel Lawrence: A lot of this is still under development. But you've seen in some of the public talks given Welcomely at the NASA advisory council and other places, there is essentially -- there are plans for other missions beyond 2024. So usually --  Host: Since we're going to stay.  Samuel Lawrence: Since we're going to stay, yes. So you've seen charts shown that show, you know, one mission a year in '25, '26, '27, '28 and continuing thereafter. So it should be interesting.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: As we establish this capability to do human planetary exploration.  Host: What would you say are both the immediate and the long-term goals of Artemis at the moment?  Samuel Lawrence: Well the long-term -- the immediate goal is to reestablish a credible capability to get human beings onto another planet. And you know, this, like I said, it's something we haven't done in a while. And if you're really going to be credible about saying, \"Yes, we can go to Mars or go to Sirius,\" or go to other places we want to go to, it makes sense to establish that capability in a place that's really only a few days away. Where you can take risks and have some confidence you might be able to get back to earth in a reasonable timeframe to preserve human life. The other -- there are other near-term objectives too. I mean, one of them besides reestablishing planetary exploration with human beings is understanding the lunar resource potential and understanding how to use it. Understanding how to incorporate that into human space flight architectures I think is a really key paradigm shift.  Host: Knowing more about what's actually there on the ground.  Samuel Lawrence: Knowing -- well, both. More about know what's actually there in the ground and providing ground trips, but also figuring out how to design systems that can leverage it once you find it there. Because again, you have to do that for just about anywhere else you want to go in the solar system.  Host: Sure.  Samuel Lawrence: So it's a key paradigm shift. And understanding how to, you know, refuel a spacecraft in microgravity or fractional gravity environments is a thing we've never -- don't have a lot of experience with. So we need to get some of that. Understanding and developing systems that can handle not just days on the lunar surface but months or even years of surface operations is critical for understanding, for enabling again longer journeys to Mars and beyond. So I think there's this whole host of technology development things that should and will come out of the Artemis program. There's scientific discoveries about the nature of the early Earth/Moon system, of fundamental planetary science processes. There's also things you can do on the Moon that aren't related to geology. There's interesting -- there's interesting things you can do from materials science. There's interesting scientific objectives for understanding the biological impacts of fractional gravity on human beings. Again, we have lots of data from ISS. We have lots of data at 1G on this planet.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: Very little between those two extremes. So having astronauts on the lunar surface for months or even years at a time or for weeks or months, possibly even years at a time will provide a critical data point for understanding what fractional gravity -- what the effects of fractional gravity are in human beings and possibly also developing coherent mitigation strategies for them. It is possible there is some number between zero and one where the deleterious effects of microgravity exposure are mitigated to some large degree. And that could be very useful for future exploration.  Host: I think it's very important that you point that out. Because a lot of times we, I think, maybe overlook the fact that the microgravity environment that we're learning about on the space station is not what you have on the Moon.  Samuel Lawrence: No. It's not what you have on Mars either. Yeah.  Host: There is gravity there. Not as much as Earth, but there is gravity.  Samuel Lawrence: There is gravity. And it turns out, you know, there are areas on the Moon, like I said, the far side is shielded. It never sees the near side. So there are interesting things you can do from radio astronomy, looking for the early cosmic dawn. There's teams of astronomers who are really excited about putting a radio telescope on the lunar far side. Again, with a field station on the lunar surface, permanent power production infrastructure, these kind of long-duration experiments become very possible. And the Moon I think will eventually become a platform very much like the ISS where you can use it for a variety of interesting things. And that's really exciting. You know, I can't -- it's difficult to predict the future. You know, always in motion, the future is. But once you establish the capability to access the Moon's surface on a regular basis, have infrastructure there to support long-duration experiments and activities, very exciting things are going to start happening. It's going to be very interesting to see.  Host: Set up on the far side of the Moon and able to look out in a way that we can't do from earth.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. Because it shields all the radio transmissions, right?  Host: Those coming from Earth?  Samuel Lawrence: Those coming from Earth. Earth is very noisy, but the far side of the moon is very quiet so you can actually do interesting radio astronomy from the lunar far side that is unique for the solar system.  Host: Talk a little bit about what kind of work we're doing now and work we need to be doing in the near-term future in order to support these goals of Artemis on the Moon.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah, it's very interesting. So some of this work, you know, we've restarted it. It was quiescent for some time. So some of that work is slowly coming back to life as we realize we have to do this again. We're looking at where do you actually land? Where are the spots on the lunar surface that are safe that can be accessed by astronauts and robotic precursor missions? How do you account for, is there enough space to put landers down close together without having dust impingement on each other? So there's a lot of applied science research going on right now as we try to answer these questions in a way that makes sense and enables value to the taxpayer. We're working on the new space suits that will enable lunar missions. We're working on developing mobility systems that will let astronauts -- you know, like rovers that will let them go.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: From their lander and go out to do exploration, working on ISRU systems, in-situ resource utilization designed to use lunar resources and produce things of value to human explorers. We have American companies working on commercial landers right now to enable the goals of the Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program. So there's a lot of work which has all of the sudden come into very clear focus thanks to the challenge of the 2024 deadline.  Host: You've mentioned just then and earlier too about international and private or commercial participation in all of this. This is not just a NASA by itself effort, is it?  Samuel Lawrence: No. No, it's not. We have -- there's been for the last decade significant international interest in lunar exploration. And I think to paraphrase John Kennedy, you know, it's as true now as it was when he said it back in 1962 at Rice University. Whatever human beings undertake, free humans must fully share. There is a lot of international interest in the Moon. And I think, you know, it is incumbent upon the United States to lead the way back. And so I think there's a lot of -- I think there's going to be a lot of opportunities, good opportunities for our international partners to make meaningful contributions to the success of the program. All that is being worked on right now, so I would imagine there's a lot of excitement out there in the domestic United States community about a renewed emphasis on lunar exploration. And there's a lot of excitement from international partners about the United States finally committing to go back to the lunar surface.  Host: Well, the European Space Agency is already participating in the Orion Spacecraft.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: But other national space agencies are I guess -- are they being encouraged to participate?  Samuel Lawrence: Yes, they're being strongly encouraged to participate and I think that would be most welcome.  Host: And you talked about in the LDEP missions, private companies are already working on some of these -- I don't know what the right way to put it is -- but science experiments that will be going and landing on the Moon on their own.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right, yes.  Host: As well as, you know, work has begun somewhere I'm sure on figuring out the actual mechanism of putting the human beings down on the Moon too.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah, that's right. While that process -- there's already -- there was already a set of -- there was an action taken earlier this year. We call it on the inside appendix E which were essentially study contracts given to industry to study human lunar landing systems. And that's in progress right now.  Host: Before we get too far away from the mention of it, we were talking a minute ago about dust, moon dust. And one of the things that I learned a lot about during all the Welcome attention to the 50th anniversary of the first Moon landing was how much of a real problem the dust was in how it messes up our stuff that we bring there.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah. That's actually true. But this is not -- so the dust is a problem. But keep in mind-  Host: I'm not saying that it can't be defeated, but it is one of the really -- one of the big things that people have to --   Samuel Lawrence: Yeah it is. It's something you're going to have to do anyway, no matter where you go in the solar system.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: It turns out you find dust. So it's something we're going to have to address. And also keep in mind that most of the Apollo systems were designed in the early 1960's before we had any sense of what the lunar surface was like. So yes, they had a lot of problems during the Apollo missions. Some of that was caused by the fact they took good guesses, guesses that pretty much actually worked.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: We'd go to the Moon, we landed safely, we returned safely. We brought back 800 pounds of lunar rocks. But you know, most of those systems were designed well in advance of any realistic or actual knowledge of what the lunar surface was going to be like. So now that we have that knowledge, now that we fully understand the characteristics of the lunar environment, I'm actually pretty confident we can come up with engineering-based solutions to most of the dust issues that people are presently worried about. So I mean, it is something you have to worry about. It is something you pay attention to. But at the same time, we actually do know what the lunar environment is like and that will make I think all the difference in the world this time.  Host: Yeah. You're starting further ahead.  Samuel Lawrence: We're not starting from zero, yeah.  Host: As we did before.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah.  Host: You've mentioned that a big part of the goal of the Artemis program is to return human beings to the Moon to stay, to create a sustainable presence. And we've talked about how we want to use the resources that we will find there in order to support this sustainable presence. Is a sustainable presence on the moon the same kind of thing -- or is it the same thing as a sustainable presence on Mars, which is the long, long-term goal of this?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, I would contend that the knowledge you get from going back to the Moon to establish a sustainable presence there will actually make a Mars mission happen a lot sooner. Because you have that workforce and industrial base recapitalized, I think it actually makes Mars missions more feasible, not less. It'll happen more quickly, not farther away. But that's common sense, right? Once you've done it on the Moon, it should be a lot easier to get the confidence back to go back to thinking about how to do Mars.  Host: You learn at least the general outlines of what you have to do. But there are going to be differences between the environments.  Samuel Lawrence: There will be key differences. Yeah, there are. But I would -- they are actually probably going to be pretty similar. I mean, if you look at the body of work that's been done Welcomely for the -- there's been a lot of series of conferences and people have thought about this a lot. There's this concept of the Mars field station. And if you look at what that is, it's shockingly similar to what you might actually envision for a lunar field station too. So I guarantee you that establishing a sustainable presence on the lunar surface will buy down a significant amount of risk and develop a significant amount of industrial experience in how to create and fabricate habitats and have them be successful for the Martian experience. You know, there is a big difference -- it will shock you I'm sure to learn -- from going from a PowerPoint slide to actual hardware. [Laughter] And that is a gap we need to figure out how to jump to before we can start to really credibly talk about going to Mars with human beings. And you will do that on the Moon in a place where you can make mistakes and it's less bad.  Host: Yeah. It's exciting to be looking at really doing something like this, doing something that we did 50 years ago, but on steroids, in a different way. No?  Samuel Lawrence: It's different.  Host: Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: Again, 50 years ago we did camping trips.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: We have never established a permanent or semi-permanent, whatever you choose to call it -- I mean, humans won't be there the whole time. They'll be there some of the time. But we've never put down permanent human-tended infrastructure on another planet before, another world I should say. The Moon is not a planet. It's a world. But we've never done that before. It's new, it's exciting, it's a capability we have never had before, and I think people say, \"Oh, the Moon, we've been there, we've done that.\" No, we really haven't. We went there five decades ago. We landed in six spots and we only stayed there for a few days. When we go back, this time sustainably, this time to stay, that is something we have never done before. And it will accrue incredible value for the United States, for our allies and it will send a powerful message to the rest of the world of what we can do when we can put our minds to it. Because you see the moon with your naked eye. You can see it every day. No matter how dark the sky is, no matter how much pollution there is, no matter how much light pollution there is, you can still see the moon. And when you have Americans living and working on the surface of the Moon that sends a powerful message to the rest of the world about what we can accomplish.  Host: And that's exciting.  Samuel Lawrence: Yes, it is.  Host: I think that's exciting. This is not the first time that the United States has said we're going to return to the Moon and build on what we've learned from Apollo. What needs to happen so that Artemis can succeed where those previous efforts didn't?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, I think -- this is just me speaking personally. I'm not going to speak for the agency in this case. This is my perspective.  Host: What do you think is required for this effort to work?  Samuel Lawrence: I think we have to be very good stewards of US taxpayer dollars, more than anything else. They trust us. It is a special obligation and a special privilege to work for the American people. And I think when you go to them and say, \"We need your support to do something really exciting and provide value,\" it is incumbent upon us to make it work. It's up to us. So we have to say, here's the value proposition. These are all of the different ways. These are all of the different industries here in the United States we're going to be creating as part of this effort. Here's all the different ways we're going to enhance science, technology, engineering, medicine in this country. And here is the value proposition. It's up to us to sell it. You know, we have to be good stewards with taxpayer dollars, but in return we have to deliver. It's up to us. So that's my answer to that question. It is up to us. We have to deliver. We have to provide value. We have to do it in a way that is different and actually works this time. It is not sufficient to say we're going to do something and not do it. If we say we're going to do it, we have to do it. We have to deliver.  Host: Dr. Samuel Lawrence, thank you very much.   Samuel Lawrence: Yeah, you're very welcome.  [ Music ]  Host: If you listened to the first part of our “Heroes Behind the Heroes” series about recovering recordings of the Apollo 11 mission control team -- by the way its episode 88 posted on April 19th -- it's still there online if you didn't. Well, you know I tried to set the scene with some historical precedent for the attraction of exploring the Moon. And now I wish I had talked to Sam Lawrence too so I could have mixed in some delicious scientific reasons why bringing the Moon into our orbit in a symbolic sense was such a draw for folks back in the 1960's and for many still is today. To get more into the details of what's on the drawing boards for the Artemis program right now, go to NASA.gov/Artemis, or check out NASA.gov and follow the links to Moon to Mars, and to humans in space.

                        "description": "Host (Gary Jordan): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 321, “Where to Land on the Moon.” I'm Gary Jordan, I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight and more. NASA is returning humans to the Moon in a sustainable way with Artemis missions. The work we do will set the course for a future of humans on the lunar surface, conducting science investigations, testing critical technologies, and catapulting our knowledge of deep space missions to prepare for human missions to Mars. Now, what may not seem so apparent is what landing on the Moon really means. Okay, so you're going to land on the Moon, just go. But not surprisingly, it's a lot more complicated than that for a variety of reasons. But one reason which we'll discuss in this episode, and shouldn't be too surprising because it's the title of the episode, and you probably saw it when you started this episode, is where to land: location, location, location.  There are a number of factors to consider from the chances of successfully landing a spacecraft, to the sustainable nature of future operations, to the interesting science that you can conduct on the surface. For the science part in particular, this has become more apparent to me after having a number of conversations about Moon geology on this podcast. The Moon isn't just one homogenous rock. Each location under consideration has an interesting story to tell. And of course, one major item here is when you start getting closer to the poles, the science gets very interesting with water ice in permanently shadowed regions. But of course, picking the right place to land can get quite complicated.   So we're going to do what we do best on this podcast and bring in the right folks to talk about it. On today's episode, we have Jake Bleacher, chief exploration scientist out of NASA's Headquarters in Washington, and Tamra George, Artemis service planning lead here at the Johnson Space Center. Looking forward to Artemis missions, these folks can give us the baseline knowledge needed to understand just what has to be considered for picking the right places to land for future human missions to the Moon. Super cool, and I'm very excited for this conversation. So let's get right into it with Jake Bleacher and Tamra George. Enjoy.   [Music] Host: Jake and Tamra, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.   Jacob Bleacher:  Hey, Gary, thanks for having us. This is a really exciting time in space exploration, and we are really looking forward to the opportunity to talk to everybody about it.   Tamra George: Yes, thank you so much for having us. I mean, the lunar surface stuff and all things Artemis are so excited to talk about. So thank you. Host:  Honestly, I'm really looking forward to it. I'm excited for this topic mostly because I'm so curious. I have an idea of what lunar surface operations are going to be for Artemis, but you guys are just so into the planning and not just for the near term, but you guys are thinking really how this evolves. So I'm very much looking forward to this, but I think what's exciting is I get to talk to both of you. Jake, with your role as more of the strategic mind, Tamra, implementing that strategy for missions going forward for Artemis. I wonder what your path was to get you to such incredible roles with an awesome responsibility. Jake, if you'll start to give us an understanding, I think you have a science background, but really what led you to becoming the chief exploration scientist?   Jacob Bleacher: Yeah, that's right. My background is science. I actually studied geology and I spent time at a NASA center studying volcanoes across the solar system. Part of that job was doing field work on volcanoes here on Earth. And so I've always had, I like to say one boot on the science side and one boot on the exploration side, because we ask many questions, what would the astronauts do when they get to the Moon or Mars or wherever we end up sending them? And so, coming from a position where I did a good bit of field work, put me in kind of a role where I could advise on that throughout my early career. Then I had an opportunity to come join NASA at Headquarters and start, you know, really digging into how do we apply and develop an architecture that can go do the types of science that our communities are asking to do. I joined just before we kind of got the direction to form Artemis. And so it's been kind of a wild ride, just a great opportunity to represent science broadly as we think that architecture through.  Host: Perfect.  Yeah. And it's going to be very interesting hearing your perspective, particularly on the science. You know, I think that's one thing we stressed a lot on this podcast, but really hearing from you just what is that interesting science? So we'll certainly get to that. Tamra, you're the one that has to take all these fantastic ideas and then implement them. What led you to having such an amazing responsibility?   Tamra George: I've been excited to jump into this role, being able to grab a hold of a lot of the things I've learned throughout my career. And I try to talk to young folks a lot about how you can take different components and really bring them to together and continue to learn and improve. And it takes everybody, right? Not just one person knows everything. So I started with shuttle and space station robotics operations and flight design and flight control, and also switched to monitoring the levels of radiation the astronauts get, they are considered radiation workers, and we try to keep those as low as possible. But a good chunk of my career was also as a hardware manager with the EVA tools that we used on the shuttle and the space station, including what we call the SAFER, lovingly, the jet pack  and bringing those tools to even when we had difficulties and operations on the space station and trying to fix equipment. So that led to deputy EVA chief engineer for a little bit and also included fun kicking off the initial geology tools designs and making sure that teams started getting funded so we could push forward to all of our commercial providers now helping with that as well. So that brought me then to where I am today, bringing all different pieces and different people together cause it's going to take all of us and stakeholders to pull that whole surface mission planning together cause there's a lot of components and a lot of expertise needed.   Host: Yeah, and I think especially with your background with spacewalks on the space station, that's not an isolated thing by any means, right? You're pulling together a lot of stakeholders to solve issues on the space station you're presented with an issue, with an objective. And it's your job to come up with a plan in order to solve that translates very nicely to the Moon. But just based on your experience having that, you know, aboard the International Space Station and microgravity, now thinking about the Moon component, what is maybe a little different between those two roles? Maybe adds a little bit more complexity or maybe seems apparent, but maybe is not?   Tamra George: Well, the loads are definitely different when it comes to the one sixth gravity versus microgravity. And so making sure we can design spacesuits that support that. Also, you know, when you're developing hardware, the difference in the loads there and then a topic that I know Jake is also very familiar with is dust. The lunar regolith, which a lot of folks lovingly call dust, it loves to attach and give us some technological challenges. So we look forward to working through that and making sure we're not bringing all that inside a vehicle and that all the systems can tolerate that as well.   Host: Yeah. And especially, this is where you're digging into that, looking at the specifics, “Okay, here's an issue. How do we solve that in order to execute the broader strategy?” Why don't we start with there. Going back to you, Jake, is getting a better sense of this broader strategy, right? We're talking about returning humans to the Moon. We're talking about the sustainable and evolving architecture of lunar surface operations. From a high-level strategy point, you know, we talk about this idea of Moon to Mars, and I think lunar surface operations for Artemis missions is part of that. Just high level when you talk about why we're going to the Moon. Jake, you mentioned there's so much interesting science on the Moon. You know, what is the high-level objectives when it comes to why we're doing this?   Jacob Bleacher: Yeah, that's great. And I like that you used the word why first, because there are a lot of questions you can ask yourself as you think about how to develop an architecture. And you already pointed out that one of our goals is to develop an approach that's flexible. We want to be able to explore and we talk about our interest in building the blueprint for exploring the solar system, right? So the Moon and Mars are part of that. That's where we're starting. But it's really about a blueprint for humankind to survive away from the Earth. How do we explore? And so we choose to start with that question. Why are we exploring? Well, the answer to that is because it is a benefit to humanity.  We tend to break that down into what we call our three pillars of exploration. And those are science, inspiration, and national posture. You brought up the science already. There's so much that we can learn about our environment. I like to say that when we go away from the Earth, we're going to learn about ourselves, really. We learn more about humanity and life and how it thrives. And that's what we're trying to understand. And the science is kind of our toolbox for doing that. But the other aspects that are important: inspiration. If you think about, for instance, Apollo. Apollo, that inspiration that was driven out of Apollo, it can't be understated. How many scientists and engineers got into that field because they had that inspiration in front of them. That is a key aspect to what we do at NASA, trying to drive that inspiration for all humankind.   Then from the position of national posture, it's like what we choose to do really helps influence globally, how we work together. You know, that posture, by us taking on these big tasks, enables us to really help build international relationships, global relationships, that really bring us all together in a positive way to go explore for humankind. So we kind of start with that. Those are our pillars for exploration. We start with that question, “why?” And then by asking that question to our international partners, to industry and academia, across NASA and with our other federal agencies, we've been able to outline a series of objectives for Moon to Mars. That kind of sets the groundwork for us from which we can start to develop that architecture. We have kind of largely grouped those together in a few areas. Science, transportation and habitation. We have a number of objectives around those infrastructure. What do we plan to build as we go out into space and explore how do we operate? And then there are some common tenets that occur across all of those. So those are the basis from which we can then decide how to build that architecture, trying to remain flexible along the way. So that's kind of the basics for the strategy that we're putting into play right now.   Host: Yeah. You're really just looking very high-level. What is it exactly that we want to accomplish? And then what is it that we want to accomplish together? I think that's an important part. You talk about international partners, there's also commercial partners as well that are a part of the mix. It's a wider objective and it's shared as well. And so I think that really leads us into understanding this, you know, this shared approach, how we, together, are approaching going to the Moon and doing operations on the surface. We'll really get into this, but, you know, I think a lot of our conversations that we have is really looking forward to that first step, right? We're looking forward to Artemis launching humans around the Moon, you know, Artemis II, and then finally returning to the lunar surface for the first time.   All these firsts are really, really important and really magical in a way. But I think what's interesting about this architecture is, and this is I think part of your task, is how is this sustained? You know, how do we get to not just returning to the Moon, but then how do we take that next step to just making sure we are continuing to have realistic and significant progress every time we go? And so how do you explain that sort of challenge, not just not just taking the steps and understanding the objectives of returning, but really understanding those long-term goals and how that evolves?   Jacob Bleacher: Yeah, those are great questions. And in part, that's why we choose to ask the first question of “why?” You can develop a different architecture based on which questions you ask first. You know, we've seen architectures in the past, Apollo's a great example where the first question was “when? ”and if you set your question as “when,” that's a very focused goal of trying to accomplish a certain technical capability in a certain time period. But timeline-based goals have an end, right? You reach that. And what we're asking are much broader questions about blueprints, about humanity, about surviving.  You brought up the word sustainability. Those are more open-ended. So as we develop a flexible architecture, we continue to look forward and move forward. And so the way we've done that is we've basically set up a series of we call segments.  So instead of thinking about just trying to complete a certain task, we're thinking about the architecture as growth and capabilities. So we start out with what we call our human lunar returns segment that's really focusing on those initial capabilities, the systems, the types of operations that we'll need to be able to do to go visit a place on the Moon that we've never been before, the South polar region. So we’ve got to get there, show we can land, get out, do some tasks, and return ourselves safely so that we can then build off that.  Okay, so the next steps after that, we'll build off of our initial successes when we move into two segments we call “foundational exploration” and “sustained lunar evolution.” And so what really marks this is an ability to deploy and place infrastructure capabilities that we can reuse when we go back to the Moon. So we're trying to get away from a series of single independent landing locations and work towards something where we can build off of what we've already done. So we'll see an expansion of our capabilities and systems and developing new operations to support the complex orbital and surface missions that we want to conduct. So we'll get there, and then we'll start to build from there. We'll have new capabilities, maybe mobility or an ability to go into different environments than we did initially. And eventually that leads to what we call sustained lunar evolution. So capabilities, systems, operations, again, that can support more regional, maybe even global exploration and doing the science at more than just one spot where we land. Initially as we do that, we move through these lunar segments we'll ever be trying to learn about what helps us prepare for making that much longer trip to Mars.   So Tamra already talked a little bit about what's different between the Moon and ISS. Well, the Moon and Mars are different as well, but this is why we talk about building this blueprint for exploration. All of these do have some commonality: learning to live in kind of inhospitable environments. None of these places are Earth. And so we have to learn how to survive in places that maybe our humankind hasn't evolved into surviving in just yet. So that's where that kind of building as we go, learning as we go, gives us that framework around which we can survive at multiple places. And again, science is kind of the backbone that helps us understand those environments we hope to go into and helps us understand how to basically put in place that infrastructure to survive.   Host: Yeah, definitely. Going to tackle the science goals. I wanted to just zoom in a little bit on this evolving architecture that you talked about from a human lunar return perspective, that's just the first step, and then it evolves into more complicated areas. You talked about even when we get to the sustained lunar revolution phase, one of the things to consider is now we're having a wider impact on the surface. And that means not just area, but really the science that's available and the things that we could do, because the technologies and the capabilities have evolved over time by us continuing these Artemis missions. But what I want to do for this episode is zoom in on that first part for just a second, the human lunar return. So Tamra, I'm going to go to you because Jake presented us with this grand idea of how these things evolve from that first step and get progressively more complicated.   But when Jake and team are coming up with an architecture to say, “Here's what those first steps look like. Here's the strategies, here's the goals.” They go to you and your team, and they say, “Okay, for the human lunar return, here are some things we got to consider.” So, Tamra, really focusing on that first step, the Moon landing mission profile. What are the things that okay, in order to achieve, now that we have the strategy, we have the general idea of that's our first step in order for us to get to this long-term strategy and goal, how do you take that strategy and implement it and turn it into operations?   Tamra George: The way that we enjoy taking what we lovingly call the architecture from the right and we take that plan, we develop the executing then from the left, and that includes so many stakeholders and expertise through our programs, like our HLS program, with their commercial providers, SpaceX, and now Blue’s on, super excited for their inputs and how they're designing and how that aids in us working towards implementing these architecture and strategies and objective needs. Then also on our EHP side of the house with the new space suit contracts and our commercial providers there, and how the designs there with Axiom in the first mission on Artemis III, and bringing all those components together and our operations team, right? We talked earlier about the space station, and we have so much experience there with our operations teams there that are transitioning into our Artemis lunar surface program as well, because we need those expertise and stakeholders to all come together. And we perform what we call these exploration mission analysis cycles long term. But basically it's this iterative process where we work with all these experts and our commercial providers to understand the capabilities and the designs and iterate on that, on how can we actually implement what we're being asked to do. And as we develop that understanding, that gets handed then over to our operations team to prepare their mission products and to really execute that with our teammates. So we're more in that mission definition. How do we define the mission with all these great capabilities and expertise across all of our stakeholders and integrate that together to a very successful surface mission.   Host:  Yeah cause there's a lot, you mentioned a lot of different pieces, right? I guess that's part of the complication is you actually have the human lander, but then how does that work with the suit? How does that work with the mission profile and where you're going to end up having to choose to land? That's got to be some of the considerations, right? Okay, so all these pieces have to work together, and that sort of informs the decisions you have to make when it comes to not only going trickling down, you said architecting from the right and go moving all the way to the left to that really concrete, “Okay, what do we have and how can we make this work? Right? So that's sort of what your team is looking at.   Tamra George: Absolutely. And that key is making sure that we're really integrating with our stakeholders across everybody, including science, as Jake mentioned, because it's going to take all of us together, right? To make this successful, we are going to need everybody and all those expertise. And it's really exciting to just see all those conversations coming together to focus in on how we're going to make this happen. Host: So Tamra, you mentioned science, right? And  of course, you mentioned a couple of different elements that I'll bring this together, but Jake, jumping over back to you again, and we can really bring this much broader for a second, cause we are focusing on the human lunar return element of this, but really high level, right? You're trying to think about not just the science objectives, like right off the bat, but really when we consider Artemis, when we consider Moon to Mars and what is the primary focus, you know, we talked about “why,” maybe this is the “what,” is the science. It's not just scooping up some dirt. Maybe people think it's just that. It's not just testing the different technologies. You guys have really put a lot of thought into the science objectives for the long term.   Jacob Bleacher: Yeah, that's right. And you know, the first thing to point out about science and the Moon is humankind has forever been aware of the Moon, right? It's a very prominent celestial feature. We've asked questions about it from the first time humans could ask questions. Why is it there? What is it? We've progressively learned more about it over time, and it's a partner. The Earth-Moon system we refer to, it influences things that we feel in our daily life, tides in the oceans, things like that. So it's a part of us. It's a part of the Earth-Moon system. And, you know, we have slowly worked our way as humankind towards getting to the Moon.  There are many scientific disciplines that benefit from human presence, even robotic presence at and around the Moon. That's what we try to capture. And we try to document that as we put together what we call our agency Moon to Mars objectives. But, you know, the Moon is just a great proving ground for us, both in science and in engineering. And it's bigger than just questions about the Moon itself. There are many questions we have humankind about just, you know, why are we here? Are we alone in this big universe? In some ways we can't answer those questions here on Earth. We can't answer what exactly the environment was like that established a foothold for life, because we have things like an atmosphere and plate tectonics that recycles the rocks and erodes away the evidence. So we can't answer the questions here that we're asking ourselves. The Moon, however, has been here with the Earth from the very beginning.   The very characteristics that make it maybe inhospitable to humans, a lack of atmosphere, no water, the plate tectonics aren't there. Those are characteristics that preserve the evidence that we would go look for. And so when we go to the Moon, we can collect samples, we can look for evidence that helps us begin to answer those questions they've put into context evidence we'll find elsewhere in the solar system  at Mars, the planets that we go to with robot. We kind of talk about it sometimes as the Rosetta Stone of understanding our solar system because it's kind of this witness plate to all the history. How has the Sun evolved over time? What has the Earth experienced with respect to collisions from other objects out in the solar system? These are all things that we can't necessarily get to here on Earth.   Then as we go, we can study what is the impact of that space environment on people, you know, what do we need to learn about how humans survive out in space before we decide to make that really long trek to a place like Mars? So the science is really foundational. We want to go learn science, but it's also important to remember, I like to talk about this as a double-headed arrow. It's very important to understand that it's that science we've already addressed and learned is what helps us understand how to build these systems. The very things Tamra was talking about. How to deal with the environment, what the environmental characteristics will really be like. That's what informs us how to build these systems so we can go spend more time out there in space.   Host: Yeah. Even taken from a practical level, you look at some of the NASA payloads that are on some of the first Commercial Lunar Payload Services missions on the Intuitive Machines, Nova-C, on Astrobotic’s Peregrine. A lot of the capabilities, those NASA payloads that those landers are armed with are things that are helping us to understand just those first steps, right? What is the characteristic of the regolith? What is the characteristic of navigation control and actually navigating to a successful precise landing on the Moon? Really just helping us with those first steps so that we can go much wider. Jake, to sort of expand on that for just a second, cause I think it's been mentioned a couple of times on this podcast, but to really drive it home, I think folks may think of the Moon as just one big rock and, you know, wherever you land, you pick up a rock and that tells you the story. But what I find through multiple conversations is, depending on where you go, there are different secrets to unlock and different stories to tell. So when you talk about an evolving architecture and think about where to go, location really helps to tell a different story on the Moon. And it's not just as homogenous as maybe people think.   Jacob Bleacher: That's absolutely correct. So the Earth is not just one big solid rock that is just one rock type. It’s a solar system object that has a history, and it's a dynamic place. It's experiencing change today. I think some of those things are lessons we've learned over the last, you know, handful of decades as we've started to send robotic explorers and even human explorers to the Moon. In fact, you know, if you look at where Apollo landed, those were all landings that occurred on the Earth-facing side, roughly near the equatorial region of the Moon. The challenge we've been given now is to go to the South polar region. And so we get this question all the time. Why? Why are you going to that part of the Moon? Well, it's exactly to the point you just raised.   The lessons we have learned suggest to us that the lighting is a very unique aspect at the poles of the Moon, because the Moon has very small axial tilt only about one to one and a half degrees. And so what we understand about day-night cycles, about lighting here on the Earth, it's very different than what we see at the poles of the Moon, even the poles here on the Earth, because our axial tilt is significant. We experience at the poles a cycle where we can be in darkness for actually months at a time, and then light for months at a time. We still have this kind of repeated pattern, but at the poles of the Moon, that really low angle tilt means that the Sun just basically stays at the horizon. I like to say if you were standing at the pole and looking at the Sun, it basically is just dancing along the horizon, going in circles around you that makes for really long shadows.  We experience basically shadows and patches of light that are transitioning back and forth on timescales that are very different. The ratio of sun to darkness is unique at different locations, and it can change over short distances, even hundreds of meters. It can be very different. You can go from places that are in low topography that in fact never see sunlight, called those permanently shadowed regions, to places that actually might see the Sun on high topography for 80 to 90% of the year. These are some of the details we're trying to understand a little bit better. But one thing that we think is that places that are decoupled from the sun, they don't experience sun ray, the Sun's plasma, they're not seeing the sunlight. Those are locations where should volatiles have ever gotten onto the lunar surface and entered into those depressions or impact craters that never see Sun. They might actually be preserved there.  We do have some evidence that shows us that those volatiles are present. And when I say volatile, I mean basically, elements, molecules that if they are easily volatilized, they turn into gas rapidly. If they were to see sunlight, they would do that. W`12`ater is a good example. So I talked about how the Moon is sort of a witness plate for the entire history of the solar system. So think about that. You potentially have volatiles that have been delivered to the Moon over the history of the solar system if they got deposited in some of these depressions, if the depressions are old enough, we could have this signature or basically, I almost think about it like a book where we would almost be looking at pages of the history of the solar system by being able to sample there. So the location, as you pointed out, is extremely valuable. This type of samples, this type of history is not preserved where we've been in the past. And so that's why, in fact, we're targeting the polar regions.   Host: So, Tamra, you hear this from Jake and from others that, “Hey, we want to go to the lunar South Pole. And oh, by the way, you know, there's these permanently shadowed regions.” The Sun is at a unique angle from the Apollo missions, and you're thinking about bringing all the different technologies together and thinking, “Oh, man, you know, how is this going to work?” So I want to address really the challenges of that, right? So we're looking at the lunar South Pole because of the interesting things that Jake just mentioned. So when they come to your team, Tamra, and they say, “Alright, how do we make this work?” When you are thinking about some of those initial challenges, you know, cause from what I know, those permanently shadowed regions are very cold, and the lighting conditions are very interesting. So how do you power a spacecraft, things like that? What are some of those challenges that you're addressing in order to meet those objectives of landing in such a unique area?   Tamra George: Great question. I think a lot of that is actually built into some of the challenges Jake mentioned that our stakeholders are all looking at. How do we meet those challenges and design around those challenges? So whether it's the illumination, again, Jake mentioned that winter versus summer and even the long shadows, and how do you make sure that our solar arrays on those vehicles are getting enough sunlight during emission to keep batteries charged during those periods, right? Or even the communication. So whether you're looking at direct to Earth with our ground antenna assets or potential relays, we want to make sure we have really good communication with our astronauts for many reasons, whether safety, to understand what's going on, or to help our science team see some eyes on what geology our astronauts are seeing as well. So making sure we have that good communication with the illumination that maintains the vehicle's capability with power and thermal, right?  The illumination challenges are also thermal challenges, as you mentioned. So we're not going to land in a PSR, or right next to a PSR where we may cause some plume interaction with that PSR because we want that science to be pristine. But it is a challenge to make sure that we can find a nice, you know, within slope constraints, within crater constraints, within blocks constraints. We like to call them boulders, but in geology on the lunar surface, they’re called blocks. Make sure things are hazard free enough for that safe landing with our astronauts, but within that walking or roving distance to a good PSR to be able to get that good science and learn, as Jake was mentioning. So we know our provider friends, SpaceX, and Blue Origin, they're actively trying to understand these challenges as well and how can they best meet where we're trying to go. So it's been exciting trying to bring everybody together to talk through that and how to get there.   Host: Yeah. And I think at least in the near-term for some of those first missions, right? You think about not just the landing aspect, the landing aspect certainly has those challenges. You mentioned, you know, getting close to the science, but really thinking about the safety aspect, I think is huge. But in order to get there, I believe, you know, we have to go into a near-rectilinear halo orbit, and in order to access some of those regions on the South Pole, which means that when it comes to landing on the Moon,  in order to launch and rendezvous with the Orion spacecraft that will ultimately take them home, they're on the surface for six days at least in some of the earlier missions. And so when you think about surface operations, and okay, once you actually successfully land on that boulder free, non-slope, close to science kind of landing site, how would we expect them to spend—them meaning the astronauts that ultimately land on the surface—how would we expect them to spend their six days? What do we care about that we want them to spend their time on for six days?   Tamra George: Well, on the first mission, of course, it's going to be the first time we're demonstrating a crude vehicle landing, right, with our astronauts. And the first time we're demonstrating a new spacesuit on the lunar surface. So some of the focus will be to checking those systems out making sure we're meeting any demonstration objectives. But then we're going to quickly shift into the main focus and how we support science activities. So there is a call out, well actually not out, it's been completed, but for selecting science payloads to be deployed on some of our spacewalks on the first mission. So the announcement of which payloads we're going to get to utilize and deploy have not been announced yet, but all those proposals have been in and going through review. And so we're anxious to see which ones get selected so we can integrate into that plan. But deploying some good external science payloads and taking samples, like you were talking about with Jake, in the area that we land, where can we work with our science team to make sure that we're getting the good samples that meet some of our strategic objectives. There's going to be tons of observations, right? And it's not going to be just outside the vehicle, but inside the vehicle going on to Mars, we really need to also learn how the human body reacts to a lot of it. So we talk about the engineering and design technical challenges, but there's a lot we need to learn about the human body as we want to continue on to Mars. And so there'll be some human body aspects of things that we're going to be looking at from the science perspective as well and observations out the window and things, too. So really just checking those boxes of yep, everything that we looked at and the strategic architecture and the mission definition to operations and where we pick to land and how our vehicle performs and how our suit performs and meeting these science objectives. We're just going to march on down through that list and try to check those boxes off for a successful mission.  Host: Well, I don't think we have to worry about them being bored while they're on the lunar surface. Sounds like they're going to have quite a bit to do. It's kind of refreshing to hear that on that first mission, of course, you need to check out the systems. This is the first time where you have these particular suits on the surface, this particular lander on the surface. So let's just make sure everything works, let's just check those boxes. But very refreshing to hear that because, you know, we have so many days on the lunar surface, we can switch gears towards the end and really start dedicating to science, deploying science payloads, maximizing our time to really utilizing every minute, every moment that we have on the lunar surface.   It's not just the touch and of an operational checkout. We can really accomplish some fascinating stuff. I wonder though, if you were to zoom in on maybe a day, right, on the lunar surface for at least that first mission, maybe towards the middle, maybe after some of those operational checkouts, I'm assuming we can predict some a spacewalk, we can expect them to have a couple of meals. We can expect them to maybe talk with us from the lunar surface and check in and folks get to actually tune in and see their faces while they're there. It's going to be a busy day, but, you know, just a little snapshot of what is it that maybe we can expect in these early phases of planning?   Tamra George: I think you said it exactly right, that entire list is actually things that are talked about almost weekly. And how do we balance all of the great things that they can do? Which includes being able to talk to the public, right? Because we want to take everybody with us. So, yes towards the middle of those six days, there'll be spacewalks, there'll be science, there'll be health things that our crew needs to do. And again, some of those medical things, but also wanting to really make sure we find that time for the crew to be able to talk to the public cause we want to go together, we want everybody to go with us.   Host: Yeah. And of course, you mentioned so many stakeholders, right? Of course, the medical community is going to want to get that data. The science community is going to want to get the lunar surface data. Operations community wants to check out their systems. Me being selfish, public affairs officer, wanting to understand, hey, we're going to get to talk to them, right? So everybody's going to want to get a piece of this, and it really just shows we're really trying to maximize their time. You know, when, when it comes to surface operations, just high level, when you think about the challenges between maybe some of the Apollo mission Moonwalks and the Artemis mission Moonwalks near the lunar surface, I'm assuming there's a lot of similarities, but key differences when it comes to doing a spacewalk on the lunar surface near the South Pole. What are some of those challenges and considerations we need to think about when we're thinking about those kinds of operations? The length of the spacewalks and even lighting conditions, things like that, communications you mentioned. What are some of those key things we need to be aware of when planning for Artemis spacewalks?   Tamra George: The biggest challenge I think we're seeing, compared to Apollo, is probably more in the illumination. We did have an Apollo mission that was representative of a little bit what we're going to see with that illumination low on the horizon. And so we're actively performing a lot of assessments. Our operations team, you know, with our EVA human mobility program, along with us and our science stakeholders and such, try to look at how can we test that differently and how can we mitigate that low on the horizon, in their face, be able to walk and through shadows and other things, and optically their eyes adjusting to all that, right? Make sure they're able to stay cognizant and aware of where they're at and getting to those science objectives. So that's probably one of the challenges being worked a lot. I mentioned that lunar regulate the dust and making sure how do we appropriately dust those suits off before going into the cabin. That's not a challenge. That's above what Apollo saw. I think it's more what we learned from Apollo, how much was brought in the vehicle that we're trying to minimize that a little bit more this round. Otherwise, I think the challenge is we can really stand on everything that our Apollo teammates have learned and grow from that. And that will, I believe, enable all those future sustained, right? We're one step at a time get to those additional longer term architecture goals.   Host:  Excellent. Yeah, so I mean, these are really just some of the first steps in those challenges, right? The sun, right in your eyes, you know, thinking through that and what that's going to look like and working on some of those challenges. And I know there's even some training now and capabilities here at the Johnson Space Center that are looking at exactly that. I got to go to one of the buildings here, and they have this wonderful simulation, these screens that give us a sense, it’s almost a VR sort of world that you can immerse yourself in and really get a sense of what that's like. And it is eye-opening. Just having those training capabilities so you can identify it and think, “Okay, how do we address this?” is going to be absolutely fascinating.   Host:  Jake, I want to go to you just to sort of wrap us up here and thinking about just these first missions, but really thinking forward, ahead to what we can expect with some of these first missions and some of those things that Tamra was mentioning about finding that Goldilocks zone and a nice spot that's close to the science, but still operational, considerate. But thinking about when we were addressing the architecture up front, going to foundational exploration, going to sustained lunar evolution and taking those steps to maximize our footprint on the lunar surface, how is it important to just make these first steps and continue to build and really stressing the importance of why lunar surface exploration is so important?   Jacob Bleacher:  Yeah, that's the critical aspect to this flexible architecture that we're working. The types of objectives that we're identifying, you know, they're broad, they're broad reaching objectives, and so they're not the kind of thing you just go and you do the whole objective in one mission. So we have to have an iterative build, and that means iterative learning about that environment so that we can operate and it means iterative, gaining more capabilities. So the capabilities we'll need, you know, Tamra mentioned earlier about, well, these permanently shadowed regions, they're probably very difficult to operate in. We're certainly not going to go land there on the first landing. We might try to land close by and maybe dip our toe into the edge of one of these things. But that's part of that learning process. So having these segments outlined early for us is helpful there.You might not fully address an objective. You might not ever fully address an objective, but you can begin to build in new answers and ask better questions about that objective by learning and developing new capabilities.  These first few missions will teach us so much about what it means to operate. What is it really like to have the Sun right on the horizon with no atmosphere shielding you from it. What will it be like for us to try and move around on that surface? How will we see the surface and interact with it? Will we be able to identify types of features we thought we could to help us decide what we want to sample? These are all operational questions that we'll ask that underpin our ability to go do the science that we want to do. But as we move forward, we may learn, “Oh, well, if we had only had this capability with us, we would've been able to do so much better.”  That's part of that iterative build, that iterative learning process. And as we progress through our segments, we'll learn how to get those capabilities in place. And this is where the tremendous opportunity for partnership comes into play. NASA can't do this alone, and that's why we're so interested in talking to our international partners and working with our commercial friends to figure out new and innovative ways to tackle some of these difficulties. And there may be more than one way to tackle some of these. And so learning about that environment, gaining experience, mission after mission, learning what we need to put in place next so that we can go do it, that's really what this evolvable and flexible architecture is all about.  Host: Very, very important, guys. This was such a fascinating conversation and I'm ashamed that I have to let you go because I feel like I could just keep you here for another three hours and we can just go through, just step by step all the different considerations you guys, cause I'm pretty sure you're deep into it. But just to be able to steal your time for just a little bit and get a taste of some of those first steps and why we're taking them so we can make those next steps and get us to learn even more next time and expand our presence, the importance of the science that we're doing for lunar exploration is just absolutely fascinating. So Jake and Tamra, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today, was an absolute pleasure to have both of you on. Thanks for all you do. This is some incredible and amazing stuff you guys are working on. Really just thinking about lunar presence and evolving lunar presence on the lunar surface from a global perspective. You talk about international partners, it’s not just us going, we're all going together. And so to bring the community together to achieve such wonderful goals is absolutely fascinating. Jake and Tamra, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.   Jacob Bleacher: Yeah, thanks for having us, Gary. And thank you for helping us tell the story.

The part of the Moon facing us is completely in shadow then. Pictured here is the traditional New Moon, the earliest visible waxing crescent, which signals the start of a new month in many lunar and lunisolar calendars.  NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has been in orbit around the Moon since the summer of 2009. Its laser altimeter (LOLA) and camera (LROC) are recording the rugged, airless lunar terrain in exceptional detail, making it possible to visualize the Moon with unprecedented fidelity. This is especially evident in the long shadows cast near the terminator, or day-night line. The pummeled, craggy landscape thrown into high relief at the terminator would be impossible to recreate in the computer without global terrain maps like those from LRO.

                        "description": "New Moon. By the modern definition, New Moon occurs when the Moon and Sun are at the same geocentric ecliptic longitude. The part of the Moon facing us is completely in shadow then. Pictured here is the traditional New Moon, the earliest visible waxing crescent, which signals the start of a new month in many lunar and lunisolar calendars.  This marks the first time that accurate shadows at this level of detail are possible in such a computer simulation. The shadows are based on the global elevation map being developed from measurements by the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). LOLA has already taken more than 10 times as many elevation measurements as all previous missions combined.  The Moon always keeps the same face to us, but not exactly the same face. Because of the tilt and shape of its orbit, we see the Moon from slightly different angles over the course of a month. When a month is compressed into 12 seconds, as it is in this animation, our changing view of the Moon makes it look like it's wobbling. This wobble is called libration.  The word comes from the Latin for &quot;balance scale&quot; (as does the name of the zodiac constellation Libra) and refers to the way such a scale tips up and down on alternating sides. The sub-Earth point gives the amount of libration in longitude and latitude. The sub-Earth point is also the apparent center of the Moon's disk and the location on the Moon where the Earth is directly overhead.  The Moon is subject to other motions as well. It appears to roll back and forth around the sub-Earth point. The roll angle is given by the position angle of the axis, which is the angle of the Moon's north pole relative to celestial north. The Moon also approaches and recedes from us, appearing to grow and shrink. The two extremes, called perigee (near) and apogee (far), differ by more than 10%.  The most noticed monthly variation in the Moon's appearance is the cycle of phases, caused by the changing angle of the Sun as the Moon orbits the Earth. The cycle begins with the waxing (growing) crescent Moon visible in the west just after sunset. By first quarter, the Moon is high in the sky at sunset and sets around midnight. The full Moon rises at sunset and is high in the sky at midnight. The third quarter Moon is often surprisingly conspicuous in the daylit western sky long after sunrise.  Celestial north is up in these images, corresponding to the view from the northern hemisphere. The descriptions of the print resolution stills also assume a northern hemisphere orientation. To adjust for southern hemisphere views, rotate the images 180 degrees, and substitute &quot;north&quot; for &quot;south&quot; in the descriptions.
